# This is a example of configuration of the default settings for eegview.
#
# Each panel group ("panel0", "panel1"...) gathers the settings related to
# one panel tab. There are numbered in the order of their appearance in the
# program (from left to right).
# 
# For each list selection widget (scale, reference, time window...), the
# settings should match the exact label displayed in the panel. If no match
# is found, the settings is silently ignored.
#
# This file should be located in the folder pointed by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or
# in $HOME/.config if XDF_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is unset
